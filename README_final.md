# AI Energy Dashboard (Python Only)

This is a simplified, fully Python-based version of an AI-driven energy forecast dashboard.

## Features

- Python-based model training using RandomForestRegressor
- Simple visualization of energy forecast vs actual consumption
- Data saved in CSV format, graphs generated with matplotlib
- Lightweight project structure for reproducibility

## Files

- `retrain_model.py`: Trains a RandomForest model and outputs predictions to CSV
- `energy_dashboard.py`: Plots actual vs predicted consumption using matplotlib
- `data/`: Folder where CSV prediction results are stored
- `models/`: Folder where trained model is saved

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib joblib
   ```

2. Train the model and generate predictions:
   ```bash
   python retrain_model.py
   ```

3. View the graph:
   ```bash
   python energy_dashboard.py
   ```
